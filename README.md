# TranscriptVisualizationAnalysis
The program will assume that the transcript will have a normal structure such as whoever is speaking will be indicated by all capital letters such as "NAME:" at the beginning of when they speak, then every word after will be what the speaker has used. This program will use regular expressions and a 3rd party libary called matplot to create the visualizations.
