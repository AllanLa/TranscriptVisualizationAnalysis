# TranscriptVisualizationAnalysis
The program will assume that the transcript will have a normal structure such as whoever is speaking will be indicated by all capital letters such as "NAME:" at the beginning of when they speak, then every word after will be what the speaker has used. This program will use regular expressions and a 3rd party libary called matplot to create the visualizations. Users can edit code to adjust for their needs as well. Three debate files are provided for example use. Must have python, matplotlib, and numpy installed.
